        <div class="lyrics-title">You're Beautiful</div>
        <div class="lyrics-text">
          I see Your face in every sunrise <br />
          The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes <br />
          <br />
          The world awakens in the light of the day  <br />
          I look up to the sky and say <br />
           <br />
          You're beautiful (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) <br />
           <br />
          I see Your power in the moonlit night <br />
          Where planets are in motion  <br />
          and galaxies are bright <br />
          We are amazed in the light of the stars <br />
          It's all proclaiming who You are <br />
           <br />
          I see You there hanging on a tree <br />
          You bled and then You died  <br />
          and then You rose again for me <br />
          Now You are sitting on Your heavenly throne <br />
          Soon we will be coming home <br />
          When we arrive at eternity's shore <br />
          Where death is just a memory  <br />
          and tears are no more <br />
          We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring <br />
          Your bride will come together  <br />
          and we'll sing <br />
 <br />
          I see Your face, You're beautiful <br />
          You're beautiful, You're beautiful <br />
        </div>
        <div class="lyrics-title">SO IN LOVE</div>
        <div class="lyrics-text">
          I'm so in love with You <br />
          You're beautiful, so beautiful  <br />
          I fix my eyes on You <br />
          You're beautiful, so beautiful <br />
 <br />
          With just one look <br />
          Everything changes <br />
          I'm captivated <br />
          I'll never be the same <br />
        </div>
        <div class="lyrics-title">ALL IS FOR YOUR GLORY</div>
        <div class="lyrics-text">
          So put me anywhere, just put Your glory in me  <br />
          I'll serve anywhere, just let me see Your beauty <br />
 <br />
          Catch me up in Your story  <br />
          All my life for Your glory  <br />
 <br />
          My God, my joy, my delight <br />
 <br />
          All is for Your glory, all is for Your name  <br />
          All is for Your glory  <br />
          That in all things You would have the first place  <br />
          That in all things You would have preeminence  <br />
        </div>

        <div class="lyrics-title">CORNERSTONE</div>
        <div class="lyrics-text">
          My hope is built on nothing less <br />
          Than Jesus' blood and righteousness <br />
          I dare not trust the sweetest frame <br />
          But wholly trust in Jesus Name <br />
          My hope is built on nothing less <br />
          Than Jesus' blood and righteousness <br />
          I dare not trust the sweetest frame <br />
          But wholly trust in Jesus Name <br />
 <br />
          Christ alone, Cornerstone <br />
          Weak made strong in the Saviour's love <br />
          Through the storm He is Lord <br />
          Lord of all <br />
 <br />
          When darkness seems to hide His face <br />
          I rest on His unchanging grace <br />
          In every high and stormy gale <br />
          My anchor holds within the veil <br />
 <br />
          When He shall come with trumpet sound <br />
          Oh may I then in Him be found <br />
          Dressed in His righteousness alone <br />
          Faultless, stand before the throne <br />
